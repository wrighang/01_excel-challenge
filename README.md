Background
Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organizations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success. For this week's Challenge, you will organize and analyze a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.

# Requirements
## Conditional Formatting
Apply conditional formatting to the following columns:
- Outcome
- Percent Funded

## Column Creation
Create six new columns:
- Percent Funded
- Average Donation
- Category
- Sub-category
- Date Created (converted format)
- Date Ended (converted format)

## Pivot Tables and Stacked Column Charts
Create a pivot table showing counts of campaigns by outcome:
- Outcomes include: successful, failed, canceled, and live
- Grouped by: Category

Develop a stacked column chart based on this pivot table, with filtering capability by:
- Country

## Pivot Tables and Line Graphs
Generate a pivot table with the following structure:
- Rows: Date Created (converted format)
- Columns: Outcome
- Values: Count of Outcome
- Filters: Parent Category and Year

Create a line graph based on this pivot table.

## Written Report
Provide a cohesive analysis including:
- Three conclusions drawn from the data
- Limitations of the dataset and suggestions for additional tables or graphs

## Crowdfunding Goal Analysis
Calculate the percentage of projects that were successful, failed, or canceled within each goal range.

Create a line chart showing the relationship between:
- Goal Amount
- Probability of success, failure, or cancellation

## Statistical Analysis
Using Excel formulas, calculate the following statistics:
- Mean, Median, Minimum, Maximum, Variance, and Standard Deviation

Provide a brief justification of whether the mean or median better summarizes the data.
